# California-Housing-Data
This is practice on using Pyspark to build a machine learning model
This is a relatively small dataset. However, i'm using Pysark to learn how to perform data preprocessing and then create a machine learning model. 


## Dataset
The dataset is from Kaggle. Here is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatmakursun/hausing-data">link</a>
The California Housing Dataset contains one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3000 people). In this sample a block group on average includes 1425.5 individuals living in ageographically compact area. <br>
These spatial data contain 20,640 observations on housing prices with 9 economic variables:<br>
* Longitude
* Latitude
* Total Bedrooms
* Population
* Household
* Median Income
* Median House Value
